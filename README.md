# Apple-Tomato-Classifier
Overview:

This project is a simple image classification model that can differentiate between images of apples and tomatoes. It uses the Bing Image Search API to collect image data for training and testing. The collected data is preprocessed to prepare it for model training, and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained using Grid Search Cross-Validation to optimize hyperparameters for better accuracy.
